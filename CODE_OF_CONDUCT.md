# Code of Conduct

## Be respectful

There will be people with whom you may disagree, or find it difficult to cooperate. Accept that, but even so, remain respectful. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour or personal attacks.

## Assume good faith

Assume that other people are acting in good faith and that they mean well.
